The SQL Power Suite's dynamic rules-based architecture allows business users to easily update an organization's taxonomy in order to reflect the most recent regulatory policy or legislative changes. The solution automatically renders web-forms/returns from the latest taxonomy, and cascades taxonomy changes throughout the system, without any need for re-coding. This reduces the dependency on outside consultants or IT for ongoing system maintenance. It fully insulates the regulator and the filing entities from XBRL's complexities, while delivering all the advantages of a complete end-to-end XBRL-based regulatory platform - ensuring maximum adoption, transparency, flexibility and compliance. SQL Power's real-time SQL Analytics platform is the most powerful SQL Business Intelligence (BI) platform on the market, delivering a pre-built data mart solution that is taxonomy-agnostic (no ETL changes required) and a BI tool in MicroStrategy that provides all Business Intelligence requirements including: standard reports, ROLAP cubes, data mining - predictive and regression modeling, mobile dashboards and ad-hoc reporting. Built organically from the ground up specifically to satisfy complex and evolving financial regulatory requirements, SQL Power's zero-footprint solution is establishing the pattern for disclosure in the 21st century - the preeminent blend of regulatory expertise and enterprise-class software engineering.",

Yet the stakes in our industry are much higher. Raised in banking, the QuantaVerse team sees what is possible when data science is well-applied to the industry’s greatest challenges. Instead of being an unwitting tool used by terrorists and criminals to further their aims, bankers can be a weapon in the fight against financial crime and the tragedies those crimes pay to support. Instead of being a bystander as customers struggle to steer a financial course for their families, bankers can pilot them to outcomes that enrich their lives today and for generations to come. These are the rewards of an insightful customer data analytics platform purpose-built for banking and leveraging an unprecedented variety of data. This is how QuantaVerse helps you improve your business while improving the world.",
